 calculate gallons of paint needed to paint a ceiling of a room
     Prompt for the length and width, and assume one gallon covers 350
     square feet. Display the number of gallons needed to paint the
     ceiling as a whole

    Constraints: use a constant to hold the conversion rate
        - ensure that you round UP to the next whole number

    CHallenges: ensure the inputs are entered as numerit values
    Dont allow the user to proceed if the value is not numeric -> done
        -implement support for a round room -> done

Not that much of a programming problem. It takes more time to do the actual math than writing the needed functions.
