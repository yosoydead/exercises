1. [x] 1) Read n as a natural number. Write a program that prints the value of the following equations:
E1 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + .... + 1/n
E2 = (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + .... + 1/n)^2

2. [x] 2) Consider the following function:
f(x) = (x+1)/ (1+x^2), if x [-1, 1]
        x + 1,         if x (-infinite, -1)
        6/(1+x),       if x (1, infinite)       
Read two values a and b. Write a program that prints the bigger value between f(a) and f(b).   

3. [x] 3) Read two integers m and n. Print the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of the two numbers.
4. [ ] 4) Read an array of n elements. Write the greatest common divisor of all the elements in the array.
