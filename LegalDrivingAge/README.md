 Write a program that asks the user for their age and compare
        it to the legal driving age of sixteen. If the user is sixteen or
        older, then the program should display “You are old enough
        to legally drive.” If the user is under sixteen, the program
        should display “You are not old enough to legally drive.”

        Constraints
            • Use a single output statement.
            • Use a ternary operator to write this program. If your
            language doesn’t support a ternary operator, use a regular
            if/else statement, and still use a single output statement
            to display the message.

        Challenges
            • If the user enters a number that’s less than zero or enters
            non-numeric data, display an error message that asks
            the user to enter a valid age.
            • Instead of hard-coding the driving age in your program
            logic, research driving ages for various countries and
            create a lookup table for the driving ages and countries.
            Prompt for the age, and display which countries the
            user can legally drive in.

A bit of a stupid problem if you ask me.
