Create a program that computes simple interest. Prompt for
    the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time,
    and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).
        
    The formula for simple interest is A = P(1 + rt), where P is
    the principal amount, r is the annual rate of interest, t is the
    number of years the amount is invested, and A is the amount
    at the end of the investment.
        
    Constraints
        • Prompt for the rate as a percentage (like 15, not .15).
        Divide the input by 100 in your program.
        • Ensure that fractions of a cent are rounded up to the
        next penny.
        • Ensure that the output is formatted as money.

    Challenges
        • Ensure that the values entered for principal, rate, and
        number of years are numeric and that the program will
        not let the user proceed without valid inputs.
        • Alter the program to use a function called calculateSimpleInterest
        that takes in the rate, principal, and number
        of years and returns the amount at the end of the
        investment. -> done
        • In addition to printing out the final amount, print out
        the amount at the end of each year. -> done

Simple problem. Only simple math involved.
