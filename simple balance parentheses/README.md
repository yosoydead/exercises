Balanced parentheses means that each opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of parentheses are properly nested.  

Consider the following correctly balanced strings of parentheses:
    ( () () () )
    ( ( ( () ) ) )
    ( () ( ( () ) () ) )

Compare those with the following, which are not balanced:
    ( ( ( ( ( ( () )
    () ) )
    ( () () ( ()

The challenge is to write an algorithm that will read a string of parentheses from left to right and decide wether the symbols are balanced.
