Write a program to evenly divide pizzas. Prompt for the number 
of people, the number of pizzas and the number of slices per pizza.
Ensure that the number of pieces comes out evenly. Display the number
of pieces of pizza each person should get. If there are leftovers, show
the number of leftover pieces.

Challenge: revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values.
    
Dont allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric. -> done
    - alter the output so it handles plurization properly -> done
    -create a variant of the program that prompts for the number of people
    and the number of pieces each person wants and calculate how many full pizzas
    you need to purchase.

I think the code is pretty readable and self-explanatory. Not that much programming involved, only some basic math.
