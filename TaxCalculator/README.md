Write a simple program to compute the tax on an order
        amount. The program should prompt for the order amount
        and the state. If the state is “WI,” then the order must be
        charged 5.5% tax. The program should display the subtotal,
        tax, and total for Wisconsin residents but display just the
        total for non-residents.

        Constraints
            • Implement this program using only a simple if statement—
            don’t use an else clause.
            • Ensure that all money is rounded up to the nearest cent.
            • Use a single output statement at the end of the program
            to display the program results.
