The children's game "hot potato" is a type of application for showing a queue in action. They line up in a circle and pass an item from neighbour to neighbour as fast as they can. At a certain point in the game, the action is stopped and the child who has the item (the potato) is removed from the circle. Play continues until only one child is left.
The program will input a list of names and a constant, call it 'num' to be used for counting. It will return a name of the last person remaining after repetitive counting by num. 
To simulate the circle, we will use a queue. Assume that the child holding the potato will be at the front of the queue. Upon passing the potato, the simulation will simply dequeue and then immediately enqueue that child, putting him at the end of the line. He will then wait until all the others have been at the front before it will be his turn again. After num enqueue/dequeue operations, the child at the front will be removed permanently and another cycle will begin.
