Create a program that calculates the area of a room
    Prompt the user for the length and width of the room
    in feet. Then display the area in both square feet
    and square meters.

    Constraints: keep the calculations separate from the output
        -use a constant to hold the conversion factor

    Challenge: revise the program to ensure that inputs are
    entered as numeric values. Dont allow the user to proceed
    if the value entered is not numeric.
        -create a new version of the program that allows you
        to choose feet or meters for your inputs
