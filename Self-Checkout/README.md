create a simple self-checkout system. Prompt for the prices and quantities of three items.
     Calculate the subtotal of the items. Then calculate the tax using a tax rate of 5.5%.
     Print out the line items with the quantity and total, and then print out the subtotal
     tax amount, and total

    Constraints: keep the input, processing, and output parts of your program separate.
    Collect the input, then do the math operations and string building, and then print out the output
        -be sure you explicitly convert input to numerical data before doing any calculations

    Challenges: Revise program to ensure the prices and quantities are entered as numeric values -> done
        -alter the program so that an indeterminate number of items can be entered. The tax 
        and total are computed when there are no more items to be entered. -> done
