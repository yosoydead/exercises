Let's pretend your company just hired your friend from college and paid you a referral bonus. Awesome! To celebrate, you're taking your team out to the terrible dive bar next door and using the referral bonus to buy, and build, the largest three-dimensional beer can pyramid you can. And then probably drink those beers, because let's pretend it's Friday too.

A beer can pyramid will square the number of cans in each level - 1 can in the top level, 4 in the second, 9 in the next, 16, 25...

Complete the beeramid function to return the number of complete levels of a beer can pyramid you can make, given the parameters of:

1) your referral bonus, and

2) the price of a beer can

For example:

beeramid(1500, 2); // should === 12
beeramid(5000, 3); // should === 16

## I did not bother making the solution recursive because it would be inefficient and there is no point to it.
